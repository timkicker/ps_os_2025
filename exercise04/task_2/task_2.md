# Explain what the following operators

- <: Uses a file as the input source (redirects input from a file instead of keyboard)

- >: Writes the standard output to a file

- 2>: Redirects error messages (stderr) to a file

- 2>&1: Combines stderr & stdout: both go to the same stream (e.g. same file or outp)
